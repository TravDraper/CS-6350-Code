# CS-6350-Code
This is a Machine Learning repository created by Travis Draper for my work in CS 6350 at the University of Utah
To use the decision tree algorithms, you need to provide a csv file and corresponding dictionaries which contain all of the possible values for each parameter.  The decision trees are capable of handling numeric values by replacing the number with a marker indicating whether it is larger or smaller than the median value in the training set.

To use the ensemble learning algorithm, follow the same procedure as you would with the decision tree code.  Provide labels for the data, and choose which method you would prefer.  Note, large forests can take a long time to train.

To use the linear regression models provide a .CSV file with the output variable in the last column, The code will implement both a stochastic gradien descent, and batch gradient descent.  Both provide fairly good accuracy given that your data is somewhat linear.
