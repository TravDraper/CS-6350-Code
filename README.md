# CS-6350-Code
This is a Machine Learning repository created by Travis Draper for my work in CS 6350 at the University of Utah
To use the decision tree algorithms, you need to provide a csv file and corresponding dictionaries which contain all of the possible values for each parameter.  The decision trees are capable of handling numeric values by replacing the number with a marker indicating whether it is larger or smaller than the median value in the training set.
